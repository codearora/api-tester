Certainly! Below is a simple `README.md` file for the Node.js script to test API connectivity.

# API Connectivity Test Script

This is a simple Node.js script to test connectivity with an API using the `axios` library. The script sends a GET request to a specified API endpoint and logs the response.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- `axios` library installed. You can install `axios` using npm (Node Package Manager).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `testApiConnectivity.js` file.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
3. Install the required `axios` library by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `testApiConnectivity.js` file in a text editor.
2. Replace the `apiUrl` variable with the API endpoint you want to test.
3. Save the file.
4. Run the script using Node.js by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   node testApiConnectivity.js
   ```

## Example

The default `apiUrl` in the script is set to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`, a free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.

When you run the script, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
Response data: {
  userId: 1,
  id: 1,
  title: 'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit',
  body: 'quia et suscipit\nsuscipit ...
}
```

If there's an error, the script will log the error message.
